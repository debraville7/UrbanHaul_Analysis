# 🚚 UrbanHaul – Optimizing Rider Performance and Operational Efficiency with Analytics

## 📌 Executive Summary
UrbanHaul is a rapidly scaling last-mile delivery platform operating across major urban markets and multiple delivery categories. As growth accelerated, leadership lacked a centralized, data-driven view of rider performance, operational efficiency, and service quality.

This project delivers a **two-dashboard analytics solution** built in Power BI:
- **Executive / Operations Overview Dashboard** for strategic decision-making
- **Rider Performance Dashboard** for operational management

Together, these dashboards transform raw delivery data into **actionable insights** that support performance optimization, cost control, service consistency, and sustainable growth.

---

## 🎯 Rationale for the Project
- **Performance optimization at scale:** Visibility into rider productivity, service quality, and workload balance is critical as operations grow.
- **Proactive risk management:** Without analytics, burnout risk and inefficiencies are identified too late.
- **Data-driven decision-making:** KPI-driven insights replace reactive, anecdotal management.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
UrbanHaul operates a complex, multi-category delivery network with varying urgency levels and route difficulty. Despite rapid expansion, leadership lacks structured insights into:
- Operational efficiency
- Individual rider performance
- Service quality consistency
- Cost-to-serve dynamics

As a result, decisions around rider management, routing, vehicle allocation, and regional scaling remain largely reactive.

This project addresses that gap by delivering a **multi-layered analytics solution** that connects rider-level performance with executive-level operational outcomes.

## 📊 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🔹 Insight 1: Rider Performance Is Highly Polarized  
📍 **Chart:** Top vs Poorly Rated Riders  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_01_rider_polarization.png)

**Takeaway:** A small group of riders significantly outperforms others, indicating both scalability potential and hidden risk.  
**Action:** Scale best practices from top performers and proactively support low performers.

---

### 🔹 Insight 2: Efficiency ≠ Earnings Across Regions  
📍 **Chart:** Operational Efficiency by Region  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_02_efficiency_by_region.png)

**Takeaway:** Some regions convert efficiency into earnings better than others.  
**Action:** Apply region-specific strategies instead of a one-size-fits-all model.

---

### 🔹 Insight 3: Delivery Priority Drives Operational Pressure  
📍 **Chart:** Delivery Volume by Priority  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_03_delivery_priority.png)

**Takeaway:** Low-priority deliveries dominate volume, but high-priority orders drive risk.  
**Action:** Segment routing, staffing, and incentives by priority level.

---

### 🔹 Insight 4: Revenue Is Concentrated by Category  
📍 **Chart:** Delivery & Revenue by Category  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_04_category_revenue.png)

**Takeaway:** High volume does not always mean high value.  
**Action:** Focus capacity on high-yield categories and reprice or bundle low-yield ones.

---

### 🔹 Insight 5: Customer Ratings Are Volatile  
📍 **Chart:** Customer Rating Trend  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_05_customer_rating_trend.png)

**Takeaway:** Service quality is inconsistent throughout the year.  
**Action:** Stabilize operations during historically volatile periods.

---

### 🔹 Insight 6: Shift Performance Is Balanced  
📍 **Chart:** Performance by Shift  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_06_performance_by_shift.png)

**Takeaway:** Performance is evenly distributed across shifts, with a slight night-shift edge.  
**Action:** Transfer night-shift efficiencies to daytime operations.

---

### 🔹 Insight 7: Vehicle Type Does Not Drive Rider Experience  
📍 **Chart:** Vehicle Performance  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_07_vehicle_performance.png)

**Takeaway:** Rider satisfaction is consistent across vehicles.  
**Action:** Optimize fleet decisions using efficiency and cost, not perception.

---

### 🔹 Insight 8: Rider Performance Is Stable Over Time  
📍 **Chart:** Overall Rider Rating Trend  
➡️ [View Chart](./visuals/insight_08_overall_rating_trend.png)

**Takeaway:** Performance is resilient but experiences short-term volatility.  
**Action:** Proactively manage seasonal dips and institutionalize year-end best practices.
